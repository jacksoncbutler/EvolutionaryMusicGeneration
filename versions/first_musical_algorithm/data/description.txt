Base Evolutionary Algorithm Changes
By Jackson Butler


Current Ongoing Changes:

- Changed Individual Genotype to type list.
    - Ex: [[
            [1, 3, 5], [3, 5, 7] # individual notes that make up the chords
           ],
           alt option
           [
            [1,0/b/#,M/m,(0-10), 3/8], [5,0,M,3,1/4], [4,#,M,3, 1/8], [4,0,M,3,1/4],
            # ^ chord, (normal, flat, sharp), (Major, minor), octave, length of note
           ],
           alt option Neo-Riemannian Transformations
           [
            [R/P/L], [R,L,]

           ]]

    - In order to adhere to Neo-Riemannian Theory
        - Parsimonious if two pitches are shared
            - Generalized parsimonious voice-leading requires
                - 2 voices are shared
                - 3rd voice proceeds by an interval no greater than twice the smallest
                    available interval (not entire sure what this means)
        - Available Transformations:
            - Parsimonious transformations
                - P: Parallel
                - R: Relative
                - L: Leading Tone
            - Non-Parsimonious transformations
                - S: Slide (opposite of P)
                - N: Nebenverwandt
                - H: Hexpole
        - 3 Cycles that use two transformations, PL, RP, and RL
            - PL and RP close rather quickly
            - don't bother with RL
        - cube dance :/

        
    - Need to update helpers(or individual)/mutate function
        - MUTATE:
        - Needs to know what type is being passed through
        - Needs to know if type list if it 2D or not?
    - Need to update helpers/randomBitstring function

- Evaluate Fitness Function need to be updated to reflect changes to Genotype

- Not much of this can be done until all required inputs have been decided...

Chords
Based on Key
Tonics: I, VI, Vb, IIIb # prolong tonic or go to sub
Subdominant: II, VII, VIb, IV # if sub go to sub or dom
Dominant: IV, III, IIb, IIVb # if dom go to dom or tonic

   P   R       L
T -> i -> IIIb -> iv

Melody
attach scale to every chord
weights for retrograde (intervals are flipped)
twice the length 
half the length
